## Technical Questions

**Q: Why isn't element selection working on some websites?**
A: Some sites use dynamic content, iFrames, or have security policies that block content scripts. Try refreshing the page or using manual CSS selectors.

**Q: The scraper stops early or misses data. Why?**
A: This can happen due to rate limiting, dynamic loading, or selector issues. Try increasing delays or verifying your selectors.

## Data & Storage

A: With an account, data is stored in MongoDB. Without an account, data is temporarily stored in browser storage. You can always export as CSV/JSON.

## Legal & Ethical

**Q: Is web scraping legal?**
